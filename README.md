## Introduction

YOLO is a simple yet powerful e-commerce platform that allows users to add and manage products. It leverages Docker for containerization to ensure consistency across various environments and to simplify the deployment process.

## Features

- **Add Products**: Use the provided form to add new products to the database.
- **View Products**: Browse through the list of available products.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Easily deploy the application using Docker and Docker-Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

### Fork and Clone the Repository

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/yolo-ecommerce.git
   cd yolo-ecommerce
   ```

### Running the Application

Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to set up and run the application.

## Docker Setup

### Building and Running Containers

You can test the application's functionality by adding a product through the provided form and verifying its persistence in the MongoDB database.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the Node.js application.
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image for the Node.js service.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Orchestrates the services required for the application.
- **explanation.md**: Provides detailed explanations for various implementation choices.
