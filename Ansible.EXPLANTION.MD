# My Node.js Application Deployment

This repository contains a Node.js application with a frontend and backend, as well as a MongoDB database. The application is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose. We use Vagrant and Ansible to automate the setup and deployment process on virtual machines.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

### Explanation of Playbook Execution Order

The order of execution in the Ansible playbook follows a logical sequence to ensure smooth deployment of the Node.js application with MongoDB. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the reasoning behind the order:

#### 1. Loading Variables (`vars_files` Section)

The playbook begins by loading variables from the `group_vars/all.yml` file. These variables are essential for configuring various aspects of the deployment, such as paths, repository URLs, and version numbers. Loading variables at the beginning ensures consistency and allows for easy management of configuration settings.

#### 2. Pre-Task Installation (`pre_tasks` Section)

The pre-tasks section performs initial setup steps before executing the main roles. In this playbook, the primary pre-task is to ensure that Git is installed on all target virtual machines. Since the subsequent tasks involve cloning repositories from GitHub, having Git installed is a prerequisite. By installing Git as a pre-task, we guarantee that it is available before attempting to clone repositories.

#### 3. Role Execution (`roles` Section)

Roles encapsulate sets of tasks related to specific components or functionalities of the deployment. The playbook includes three roles:

##### a. MongoDB Role

This role is responsible for setting up the MongoDB database. It includes tasks for installing Docker and Docker Compose (if not already installed) and deploying the MongoDB container. By executing this role first, we ensure that the database service is up and running before deploying the frontend and backend applications, which depend on MongoDB.

##### b. Frontend Role

The frontend role handles the deployment of the frontend application. It includes tasks for cloning the frontend repository from GitHub and deploying the frontend container using Docker Compose. Since the frontend application may rely on data stored in the MongoDB database, it's essential to deploy it after ensuring that the database service is operational.

##### c. Backend Role

Similar to the frontend role, the backend role deals with the deployment of the backend application. It clones the backend repository and deploys the backend container using Docker Compose. Like the frontend, the backend may interact with the MongoDB database, so it's deployed after ensuring that the database service is running.

### Conclusion

The order of execution in the Ansible playbook follows a logical sequence to ensure smooth deployment of the Node.js application with MongoDB. By loading variables first, performing pre-installation tasks, and then executing roles in a specific order, we establish a robust foundation for deploying the application components. This approach minimizes errors, ensures dependencies are met, and sets up the environment for successful application deployment.
